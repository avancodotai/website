# Getting Started with BJJ Note-Taking: A Complete Guide

If you've been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for any length of time, you know the feeling: you learn an amazing technique in class, drill it repeatedly, maybe even hit it during rolling... and then a week later, you can barely remember the setup.

Sound familiar?

## Why Most BJJ Practitioners Don't Take Notes

Despite the obvious benefits, most BJJ practitioners never develop a consistent note-taking practice. The reasons are always the same:

- "I'm too tired after training"
- "I'll remember it"
- "I don't know what to write"
- "My notes are a mess"

Here's the truth: **the difference between a good training session and actual progress is what you do after you leave the mats.**

## The Science Behind Note-Taking

Research shows that students who take notes retain 50% more information than those who don't. This isn't just about writing things down—it's about active processing.

When you take notes:

1. You **encode** the information (initial learning)
2. You **consolidate** the memory (moving it to long-term storage)
3. You create **retrieval cues** (making it easier to recall later)

This is exactly what you need for BJJ, where techniques build on each other and small details make huge differences.

## What to Capture in Your Training Notes

### The Essentials

Every training note should include:

- **Date and time** - Track your consistency
- **Who you trained with** - Partner history matters
- **What you worked on** - Positions, techniques, concepts
- **Key insights** - The "aha" moments that clicked

### Going Deeper

Once you have the basics, add:

- **Problems you encountered** - What didn't work
- **Questions to explore** - Things to research or ask your coach
- **Game plan adjustments** - How this affects your strategy
- **Physical notes** - Injuries, fatigue, recovery needs

## The 5-Minute Post-Training Framework

You don't need to write an essay. Here's a simple framework that takes just 5 minutes:

### 1. Quick Stats (30 seconds)
- Partners: John, Sarah, Mike
- Rounds: 6
- Duration: 90 minutes

### 2. Main Focus (1 minute)
- Worked on: Triangle from guard
- Coach emphasized: Controlling the angle before finishing

### 3. Key Details (2 minutes)
- Setup: Break posture → high guard → angle off → throw leg over
- Mistake I made: Trying to finish before securing the angle
- Adjustment: Get perpendicular FIRST, then squeeze

### 4. Wins & Struggles (1 minute)
- ✅ Hit the triangle twice on John
- ❌ Got passed repeatedly - need to work on guard retention

### 5. Next Session (30 seconds)
- Ask coach about defending the triangle
- Drill guard retention with Sarah

## Common Note-Taking Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too Much Detail
You don't need to document every single movement. Focus on the **critical details** that make the technique work.

**Instead of:**
> "Started in closed guard, grabbed the sleeve with my right hand, then grabbed behind the head with my left hand, then..."

**Write:**
> "Triangle from closed guard: Posture break → angle → leg over → squeeze"

### Mistake 2: No System
Random notes in random places make it impossible to review and learn from your training history.

**Solution:** Use one consistent system (notebook, app, or tool like Avanço)

### Mistake 3: Never Reviewing
Taking notes without reviewing them is like going to class without drilling. The magic happens in the review.

**Solution:** Review your notes before every training session (2 minutes)

## Digital vs. Paper Notes

### Paper Pros:
- No battery needed
- Fast and flexible
- No distractions

### Paper Cons:
- Hard to organize and search
- Can't add photos/videos easily
- Easy to lose

### Digital Pros:
- Searchable and organized
- Can include media
- Backed up automatically
- AI can help structure and enhance

### Digital Cons:
- Requires device/app
- Can be distracting
- Learning curve

**My recommendation:** Start with whatever you'll actually use. Consistency beats perfection.

## Making It Stick: The Review Habit

Here's the secret that transforms note-taking from busywork into a superpower:

**Review your notes before every training session.**

This takes 2-3 minutes and:
- Refreshes your memory on recent techniques
- Helps you set intentions for the session
- Creates connections between concepts
- Identifies patterns in your game

## Advanced: Using Spaced Repetition

Once you're comfortable with basic note-taking, consider using spaced repetition to lock in techniques long-term.

This means reviewing:
- New techniques: Daily for a week
- Recent techniques: Weekly for a month
- Established techniques: Monthly forever

Tools like Avanço automate this with smart flashcards that know exactly when to remind you.

## Start Simple, Stay Consistent

Don't try to implement everything at once. Here's your action plan:

**Week 1:** Just write down what you worked on after each session
**Week 2:** Add key details and insights
**Week 3:** Add wins, struggles, and next steps
**Week 4:** Start reviewing before sessions

In a month, you'll have a training journal that actually helps you improve faster.

## The Bottom Line

BJJ is a marathon, not a sprint. The practitioners who progress fastest aren't always the most athletic or the most talented—they're the ones who **systematically capture and review what they learn**.

Five minutes of note-taking after training could be the difference between plateauing and breaking through.

Start today. Your future self on the podium will thank you.
