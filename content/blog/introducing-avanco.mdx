# Introducing AvanÃ§o: Your BJJ Training Companion

We've been working on something special for the BJJ community, and we're excited to finally share it with you.

**AvanÃ§o** (Portuguese for "to advance, to progress, to level up") is your complete BJJ training companionâ€”combining AI-enhanced note-taking, smart flashcards, personalized training plans, and progress tracking in one seamless experience.

## The Problem We're Solving

If you train BJJ, you've experienced this:

You show up to class excited to learn. Your coach shows you an incredible technique. You drill it, hit it in rolling, feel like you've got it down.

Fast forward two weeks: you can barely remember the setup.

Meanwhile, you're juggling:
- Messy notes scattered across notebooks and phones
- Techniques you *meant* to drill but forgot about
- No clear sense of what to focus on next
- Difficulty tracking actual progress over time

**We built AvanÃ§o to fix this.**

## What Makes AvanÃ§o Different

### 1. AI-Enhanced Notes

Take quick voice or text notes during or after training. AvanÃ§o's AI automatically:

- Structures your raw notes into organized technique breakdowns
- Identifies key positions, submissions, and concepts
- Extracts action items and areas to improve
- Links related techniques together

**Before:**
> "rolled with john today, he caught me in triangle from guard, need to watch posture more, tried that sweep from youtube didnt work"

**After (AI-Enhanced):**
- **Training Partner:** John
- **Duration:** 6 rounds
- **Key Technique:** Triangle from closed guard
- **What Happened:** Caught in triangle due to posture break
- **Areas to Improve:** Maintain upright posture in closed guard
- **To Review:** Guard posture fundamentals

No more messy, unstructured notes. Just clear, actionable insights.

### 2. Smart Flashcards with Spaced Repetition

Your notes automatically become flashcards using scientifically-proven spaced repetition.

The system knows:
- When you learned each technique
- How well you know it
- Exactly when to remind you to review

This means you actually *remember* what you learn, long-term.

### 3. Personalized Training Plans

Based on your notes, goals, and progress, AvanÃ§o creates custom training plans:

- "This week, focus on guard retention"
- "You're getting caught in this position oftenâ€”here's a drill"
- "You haven't reviewed this fundamental in a while"

It's like having a personal coach analyzing your training 24/7.

### 4. Progress Analytics

See your growth with detailed stats:
- Techniques mastered
- Most common training partners
- Position frequency heatmaps
- Mat time trends
- Improvement areas over time

Finally, data-driven insights into your BJJ journey.

## Why We Built This

The founding team has been training BJJ for a combined 30+ years. We've tried every note-taking app, every journaling system, every tracking method.

Nothing was built specifically for martial arts. Nothing understood the unique challenges of learning a complex, physical, conceptual art like BJJ.

So we built it ourselves.

## Our Design Principles

### 1. Effortless Input
Taking notes should take seconds, not minutes. Quick voice notes, rapid text capture, or even photo uploads of technique diagrams.

### 2. Intelligent Processing
The AI should do the heavy liftingâ€”structuring, organizing, connecting, and highlighting what matters.

### 3. Actionable Output
Every feature should answer: "What should I focus on next to get better?"

### 4. Respectful of Your Time
We know you're tired after training. The app works around your schedule, not against it.
